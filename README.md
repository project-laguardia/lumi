# Lumi

A LuCI port from `uci` to `mgmt`.

# Porting

The gitignore is already configured to ignore the `luci` directory. To start porting, you can clone `luci` to that location:

```pwsh
git clone https://github.com/openwrt/luci
```

To read up on how `luci` is built, you can start here:
- wiki: https://github.com/openwrt/luci/wiki
- components: https://github.com/openwrt/luci/wiki/Modules
- build system: https://github.com/openwrt/luci/wiki/Installation

My work with porting will be logged in `PORTING.md` show casing my active work. For archived work, you can see the porting directory.
